A new sampler project, currently in breadboard phase:

- Raspberry Pi Pico as the brain
- 2 line x 16 char lcd because I think it's cute
- 4 sequenced sram chips [insert model]
- audio in, electret mic, sync pulse out
- 5 buttons and two pots
- Adafruit battery thingy [insert model]

More to come! Hoping to bring this to board design and production state but we'll see :)
